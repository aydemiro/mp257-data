# mp257-data
Source data and code used in manuscript mp257. 

data folder contains all data used in the figures and tables. Each of the other folders contains a single Jupyter Notebook that contains the code. Details of what each notebook/folder contains is provided below.


## figure_1_cph_models_summary
#### COX Proportional Hazards Model Summary  
[This notebook](figure_1_cph_models_summary/model_summary_fig_1.ipynb) contains the code for generating figure 1, as well as supplementary data tables 1-16.


## figure_2_c4_expression 
#### C4A and C4B expression
[This notebook](figure_2_c4_expression/c4_expression.ipynb) contains the code for generating main figure 2: C4A and C4B expression stratified on tri-SNP dosage. 

## figure_3_c4_CNV
#### C4 copy number analysis
[This notebook](figure_3_c4_CNV/c4-coverage-fig_3.ipynb) carries out the C4 genes copy number analysis. Creates main figure 3, supplementary figure 13 and supplementary tables 8 and 9.

## figure_S1_S2_t1d_cph
#### COX Proportional Hazards Model for Type 1 diabetes Outcome

[This notebook](figure_S1_S2_t1d_cph/t1d_cox_PH_models.ipynb) contains the code for generating supplementary figures 1 and 2.  
It should be referenced for Cox PH model code for other notebooks as it is commented with detailed explanations.
## figure_S3_S4_ia_cph
#### COX Proportional Hazards Model for Islet Autoantibody Outcome  

[This notebook](figure_S3_S4_ia_cph/islet_autoantibody_cox_PH_models.ipynb) contains the code for generating supplementary figures 3 and 4.  

## figure_S5_S6_gada_cph
#### COX Proportional Hazards Model for GADA-first Outcome
[This notebook](figure_S5_S6_gada_cph/gada_cox_PH_models.ipynb) contains the code for generating supplementary figures 5 and 6. 

## figure_S7_S8_iaa_cph
#### COX Proportional Hazards Model for IAA-first Outcome  

[This notebook](figure_S7_S8_iaa_cph/iaa_cox_PH_models.ipynb) contains the code for generating supplementary figures 7 and 8.  

## figure_S9_S10_cd_cph
#### COX Proportional Hazards Model for Celiac Disease Outcome  
[This notebook](figure_S9_S10_cd_cph/cd_cox_PH_models.ipynb) contains the code for generating supplementary figures 9 and 10.  

## figure_S11_S12_cda_cph
#### COX Proportional Hazards Model for Celiac Disease Autoantibody Outcome  
[This notebook](figure_S11_S12_cda_cph/cda_cox_PH_models.ipynb) contains the code for generating supplementary figures 11 and 12.  

## tables
[This notebook](tables/tables.ipynb) contains the code showing how the tables in the paper is generated from the data.
